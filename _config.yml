## 🧠 Why This Challenge Matters

Backdoor attacks can cause VQA models to:
- Misidentify objects (e.g., in autonomous vehicles)
- Ignore threats (e.g., weapons in surveillance)
- Miscount (e.g., in logistics or healthcare)

This challenge promotes trust, safety, and **AI robustness** for real-world applications.
