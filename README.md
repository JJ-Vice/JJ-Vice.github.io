# ICIP 2025 Grand Challenge  
## Poison Sample Detection and Trigger Retrieval in Multimodal VQA Models

---

## üìå Overview

Multimodal Visual Question Answering (VQA) models are increasingly used in applications from autonomous vehicles to medical diagnostics. However, they are vulnerable to **backdoor attacks**, where hidden triggers cause adversarial behavior.

This challenge invites the community to:
- Detect **poisoned samples**
- Identify **trigger severity**
- Enhance **security** in VQA models

It consists of **three tasks**:
- Object Identification  
- Threat Detection  
- Object Counting

Each task includes **three backdoor-injected models** (9 total). Participants will receive a mixed dataset of poisoned and clean samples to evaluate.
